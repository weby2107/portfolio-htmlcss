          <h2>The Richest Poor Man</h2>
          <p>
            <b>“My religion is humanitarianism…</b> which is the basis of every
            religion in the world,” says Edhi the most admired philanthropist of
            Pakistan. If we, for the sake of an impartial review, ignore all
            impressions that the name Edhi invokes in our minds and examine this
            conviction carefully, we come to know the level of clarity of
            thought and deep insight into human psyche and religious maturity
            Edhi possesses. He connects to the idea of religious belief at its
            core: humanitarianism or concern for human welfare.
          </p>
          <h2>Edhi’s journey</h2>
          <p>Born to a family of traders in Gujarat, Mr Edhi arrived in Pakistan in 1947.

            The state’s failure to help his struggling family care for his mother – paralysed and suffering from mental health issues – was his painful and decisive turning point towards philanthropy.
            
            In the sticky streets in the heart of Karachi, Mr Edhi, full of idealism and hope, opened his first clinic in 1951. “Social welfare was my vocation, I had to free it,” he says in his autobiography, ‘A Mirror To The Blind’.
            
            Motivated by a spiritual quest for justice, over the years Mr Edhi and his team created maternity wards, morgues, orphanages, shelters and homes for the elderly – all aimed at helping those who cannot help themselves.
            
            The most prominent symbols of the foundation – its 1,500 ambulances – are deployed with unusual efficiency to the scene of terrorist attacks that tear through the country with devastating regularity.</p>
